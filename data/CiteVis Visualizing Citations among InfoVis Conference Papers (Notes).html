<h2>CiteVis Paper and Citation Notes</h2>
<p>
In counting and logging the citations between the years of IEEE
InfoVis papers, we encountered some issues and problems within Google
Scholar.  Below we identify the "issues" that we found.  These fall
into two categories.  First, the proper IEEE InfoVis conference paper
simply does not appear (on its own) in Google Scholar.  Typically in
this case, the paper has been merged with another similar paper. In
each of these cases, we note below the paper that we included in CiteVis.
Second, for a number of the InfoVis papers, an alternate, often longer
version of the paper was published at a different venue. For example,
from 2001 to 2005, the authors of some of the best papers at the
conference were 
asked to prepare a longer version for either <i>IEEE Trans. on
    Visualization and Computer Graphics</i> or <i>Information
    Visualization</i>.  In many cases, these longer versions of a
paper have received more citations over time. For these papers,
CiteVis still only includes citations to the actual IEEE InfoVis
conference paper.

<h3>1. Missing IEEE InfoVis paper</h3>
For these papers, the InfoVis paper proper is not in Google Scholar
(it may be merged and listed with another paper),
so we use the article noted below within CiteVis.

<h3>2. Alternate/extended version exists</h3>
For the papers below, we use the formal IEEE InfoVis paper within
CiteVis, but the authors also published an alternate, often extended,
version of the article.  In some cases, these papers below have received more
citations than the corresponding InfoVis paper.
